This R package provides an algorithm for nonlinear global optimization
based on the variable neighbourhood trust region search (VNTRS)
algorithm proposed by Bierlaire et al. (2009) “A Heuristic for Nonlinear
Global Optimization”. The algorithm combines variable neighbourhood
exploration with a trust-region framework to efficiently search the
solution space. It can terminate a local search early if the iterates
are converging toward a previously visited local optimum or if further
improvement within the current region is unlikely. In addition to global
optimization, the algorithm can also be applied to identify multiple
local optima.

## Installation

You can install the released package version from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("vntrs")
```

## How to get started

1.  Specify a function `f` that computes value, gradient, and Hessian of
    the objective to be optimized and returns them as a named list with
    elements `value`, `gradient`, and `hessian`. Note that `gradient`
    and/or `hessian` can be unspecified, in which case finite
    differences are used.

2.  Call `vntrs::vntrs(f = f, npar = npar, minimize = minimize)`, where

- `npar` is the number of parameters of `f` and

- `minimize` determines whether `f` should be minimized
  (`minimize = TRUE`, the default) or maximized (`minimize = FALSE`).

Optionally, the algorithm can be tuned by setting dedicated control
arguments (for example `init_runs` or `neighbors`, see `help("vntrs")`
for details).

## Example

The example below minimizes the well-known [six-hump camel
function](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/camel6.html), which has two
global minima.

``` r
set.seed(1)

camel <- function(x) {
  x1 <- x[1]
  x2 <- x[2]
  value <- (4 - 2.1 * x1^2 + x1^4 / 3) * x1^2 + x1 * x2 + (-4 + 4 * x2^2) * x2^2
  gradient <- c(
    8 * x1 - 8.4 * x1^3 + 2 * x1^5 + x2,
    x1 - 8 * x2 + 16 * x2^3
  )
  hessian <- matrix(
    c(
      8 - 25.2 * x1^2 + 10 * x1^4, 1,
      1, -8 + 48 * x2^2
    ),
    nrow = 2,
    byrow = TRUE
  )
  list(value = value, gradient = gradient, hessian = hessian)
}

vntrs::vntrs(
  f = camel,           # objective that supplies value, gradient, Hessian
  npar = 2,            # two variables (x1 and x2)
  init_runs = 5,       # start from 5 random points
  neighborhoods = 5,   # try 5 neighbourhood radii per trust region
  neighbors = 5,       # evaluate 5 trial points per neighbourhood
  lower = c(-3, -2),   # lower search bounds for x1 and x2
  upper = c(3, 2),     # upper search bounds for x1 and x2
  collect_all = TRUE,  # also look for local optima
  quiet = FALSE        # show status messages
)
