\title{vntrs: Variable Neighborhood Trust Region Search}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

An algorithm for nonlinear global optimization based on the variable neighbourhood trust region search (VNTRS) algorithm proposed by Bierlaire et al. (2009) "A Heuristic for Nonlinear Global Optimization" \doi{10.1287/ijoc.1090.0343}. The algorithm combines variable neighbourhood exploration with a trust-region framework to efficiently search the solution space. It can terminate a local search early if the iterates are converging toward a previously visited local optimum or if further improvement within the current region is unlikely. In addition to global optimization, the algorithm can also be applied to identify multiple local optima.
