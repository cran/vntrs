Description: An algorithm for nonlinear global optimization based on the 
    variable neighbourhood trust region search (VNTRS) algorithm proposed by 
    Bierlaire et al. (2009) "A Heuristic for Nonlinear Global Optimization" 
    <doi:10.1287/ijoc.1090.0343>. The algorithm combines variable neighbourhood 
    exploration with a trust-region framework to efficiently search the solution 
    space. It can terminate a local search early if the iterates are converging 
    toward a previously visited local optimum or if further improvement within 
    the current region is unlikely. In addition to global optimization, the 
    algorithm can also be applied to identify multiple local optima.
